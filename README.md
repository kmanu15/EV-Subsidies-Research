## 📊 Key Insights

1. **Disproportionate Distribution of Subsidies**
    - The top income quintile received 50.1% ($550 million) of the total EV subsidies in Washington, more than the combined subsidies for the bottom four quintiles ($548 million).
    - Regression analysis shows a significant positive relationship between income and subsidies per household: an additional $1,000 in median income correlates with an $8 increase in subsidies.
    
2. **Longer commute times Linked to Lower EV Adoption**
    - People with longer commute times are less likely to own an EV, likely due to refueling needs and the lack of EV infrastructure in rural areas.

3. **Ineffective Equity Goals of Subsidies**
    - EV subsidies primarily benefit high-income households, undermining the equity goals of making EVs more accessible to low-income buyers.
    - Policy suggestions include allocating larger subsidies for low-income individuals or incentivizing the purchase of used EVs to make the program more equitable.
